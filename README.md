# My_Perceptron_Python
A minimalist Python implementation of a single-layer perceptron without external frameworks or libraries. This perceptron computes outputs through weighted sum of inputs and weights, applies a step function for activation, and adjusts weights using the delta rule (Perceptron Learning Rule)
